- Algorithm Understanding
Feature selection methods are intended to reduce the number of input variables to those that are believed to be most useful to a model in order to predict the target variable. What algorithms can be used to automatically select the most important features (regression, etc..)? Describe at least 3?

Correlation Coefficient
Random Forest Importance
Exhaustive Feature Selection

- Explain data leakage and overfitting (define each)? Explain the effect of data leakage and overfitting on the performance of an ML model.


- Explain what our outliers in your data? Explain at least two methods to deal/treat outliers in your data?


- What is feature scaling and why is it important to our model? Explain the different between Normalization and Standardization?
